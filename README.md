# Gauss-Jordan Elimination in C

This C program performs **Gauss-Jordan elimination** on a 3x4 matrix to solve a system of linear equations. The program reads a predefined matrix, performs row operations to reduce it to **reduced row echelon form (RREF)**, and prints the resulting matrix.

## Features

- Initializes a 3x4 matrix with sample values.
- Displays the original matrix.
- Performs row operations for Gauss-Jordan elimination:
  - Normalizes pivot elements to 1.
  - Eliminates other elements in the pivot column.
- Prints the intermediate steps and final RREF matrix.
